# TaaS  
## Introduction  
*If you role a dice, it turns hunderad times...*  
TaaS in persian means dice, and this project was created with this name because it was a random idea that were generated suddenly, so it's like a dice.  
## Why TaaS  
Recently in IoT platforms and developments, the scalibility of IoT platforms is becoming a great concern. As more nodes are connected, the cloud must be responsible for handling such huge amount of data. Because of this vast data, platforms that are capable of handling such huge amount of data has become rare, or if found, if sth goes wrong in one endpoint or if someone does some nasty things with your server all of your data is lost or at least heavily corrupted.   
By using TaaS you can make sure that your IoT platfrom is infinitely scalable. It can run on any number of computers and servers by using ```docker``` and containers.
